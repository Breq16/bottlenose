        How <i>correct</i> are the tests you see? (That is, based on
        the assignment, do the tests expect the proper results?)
      options:
        - >-
          Great: all tests are checking for behaviors specified by the
          problem, and their expected answers make sense.
        - >-
          Good: most tests are checking for behaviors specified by the
          problem, but some of the expected answers might be mistaken.
        - >-
          Ok: the tests are a mix of good answers and mistakes.
        - >-
          Not good: most tests have problems, or the expected answers
          are mostly wrong.

        How <i>thorough</i> are the tests you see? (That is, do they
        cover the complete behavior requested by the assignment?)
      options:
        - >-
          Great: all behaviors are accounted for
        - >-
          Good: most behaviors are tested, but some are missing
        - >-
          Ok: there are quite a few missing tests
        - >-
          Not good: there are nowhere near enough tests to cover the
          behavior of the assignment

        If you have any further feedback on this code (how readable it
        is, how clear it is to figure out what the tests are doing, or
        any other comments), leave them here

              As long as their answer is polite, appropriate, and does not
              give away too much information about the rest of the
              problem, <i>and</i> their answers above are complete, give
              full credit.
            feedback: Well done.

              If they answered anything other than Great above, but
              did not leave sufficient feedback, mention it here.
            feedback: You should probably have left more feedback

              Their answer is rude or offensive -- leave a <b>polite</b>
